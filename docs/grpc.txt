gRPC Documentation
-------------------------
The location data should conform to the following protobuf definition:

'''
message LocationMessage {
    int32 person_id = 1;
    string latitude = 2;
    string longitude = 3;
}
'''

For example, here is a sample payload:

'''
{
    "person_id": 2,
    "latitude": "21.0161488",
    "longitude": "105.7644546"
}
'''

The gRPC server is hosted by the 'udaconnect-location-ingester' microservice on port 5005 and then expose as NodePort as 30005

A sample gRPC client 'grpc_client.py' has been provided in the 'udaconnect-location-ingester' microservice to illustrate sending location data to the location ingester.


To verify, we have to access to the shell of pod

'''
export LOCATION_INGESTER_POD=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app=udaconnect-location-ingester" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}") # get the pod name

kubectl exec -it $LOCATION_INGESTER_POD sh # access shell of pods

# after that we can access grpc_client

python grpc_client.py
'''
